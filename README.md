What I learned:
- Code is more maintainable and reusable when packaged into a web component
- Styles of web components aren't affected by the DOM
- Shadow DOM is attached to an element instead of an HTML file
- Autonomous custom elements inherit from the HTML base element, so there is no default behavior
